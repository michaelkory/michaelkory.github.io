Question 1:

Hello,

I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:
- Records
- Indexing

I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking." 

Cheers,
George

Answer 1:

Hi George!

I'd be happy to help. Records are composed of fields, each of which contain an item of information, and a set of records would be a dataset. For example, a customer file might contain records that have fields to store a name, address, phone number. An index is used to locate date more quickly without have to search every record everytime the dataset is accessed.

"Custom Ranking" is the most direct and powerful way to adapt Algolia to your business. When you classify records with business metrics like bestseller, most popular, or highest rated, Algolia can ensure that your best products appear first to your clients.

All the best!

Question 2:

Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Regards,
Matt

Answer 2:

Hi Matt!

I'm really sorry to hear that you're not loving the new dashboard design. For your use case, I would encourage you to consider using one of our API clients to clear and delete indices, you might find that to be a more efficient workflow.

You can find more information about managing your indices here: https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/manage-your-indices/

All the best!

Question 3:
Hi,

I'm looking to integrate Algolia in my website. Will this be a lot of development work for me? What's the high level process look like?

Regards,
Leo

Answer 3:

Hi Leo!

That's a great question! Implementing Algolia can be broken down into a simple 3-step process: index your data with us, configure any necessary relevance or ranking settings, and build a search user interface.

There's a lot that goes into creating a full search solution, but our docs will walk you through every step. This page describes the implementation process: https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/implementation-process/

I hope that's helpful. Feel free to reach out anytime if you have further questions.

All the best!

Michael
